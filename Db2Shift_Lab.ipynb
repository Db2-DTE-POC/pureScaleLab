    "# Db2 Click to Containerize Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying an existing Db2 to OpenShift, Kubernetes, or Cloud Pak for Data usually involves some form of export and import and a lot of work! The new Db2 Shift tool moves your on-premises database directly to the Cloud â€“ with no exporting of data! \n",
    "\n",
    "Db2 Shift can migrate your 10.5, 11.1 and 11.5 database directly into a Db2 container with no additional effort. This lab will take you through the IBM Db2 Shift program and how it can help modernize your Db2 databases quickly and efficiently!\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab covers the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to install Db2U on a Kubernetes cluster\n",
    "* An overview of the Db2 Shift program\n",
    "* Four shift scenarios:\n",
    "  * Shift Db2 11.5 database to Db2U on Kubernetes\n",
    "  * Shift Db2 11.5 database via clone and deploy functions\n",
    "  * Upgrade Db2 11.1 Columnar database to Db2 on K8s\n",
    "  * Shift Db2 11.5 database to Db2 11.5 Instance with HADR\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy the lab, and we hope you find the new Click to Containerize Db2 Shift tool to be useful in your modernization plans for Db2!"
